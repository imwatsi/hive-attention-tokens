# Hive Attention Tokens Protocol (Whitepaper)

---

*WIP - more details are being added as the protocol develops*

Current Development Stage: PRE-ALPHA

---

Hive Attention Tokens (HAT) is a sidechain and protocol for attention tokens, controlled by accounts on the Hive blockchain. It consists of a core protocol that handles token related logic and a sub-protocol implementation of Native Ads that enables the existance of an attention economy based on those tokens.

## Chain

The HAT chain uses the Delegated Proof of Stake algorithm (and other layers still in development) for consensus, with the native HAT token utilized as a governance token.

- Block time: 1 second
- Consensus algorithm: Delegated Proof of Stake
- Native Token: HAT

## HAT

To create the initial distribution, HAT will be created in a once-off airdrop to all Hive accounts that have been active since Hive's inception, as of a future snapshot date to be announced. 

HAT use-cases:

- Governance: voting for witnesses on the HAT chain and other future governance needs
- Resource allocation: acquiring bandwidth for HAT accounts and token contracts (still WIP)
- Token creation fees


## Native Ads Subprotocol

A protocol that enables Hive account holders to monetize ad space and time to advertizers in the ecosystem, using HAT-based tokens. Features include realtime bid-based markets for ad spaces, moderation features for monetizer accounts and automatic representation of ads based on their state.
